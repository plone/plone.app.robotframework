Writing Robot Framework tests with plone.app.robotframework
===========================================================

**plone.app.robotframework** provides `Robot Framework
<http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/>`_ compatible resources and tools for
writing functional Selenium tests (including acceptance tests) for Plone CMS
and its add-ons.

See how we used this for Plomino to run some robot tests at SauceLabs:

- https://github.com/fulv/Plomino/compare/github-main
- https://travis-ci.org/fulv/Plomino
- https://saucelabs.com/u/fulv_plomino

And see also a minimal example:

- https://github.com/datakurre/example.product/tree/p.a.robotframework
- https://travis-ci.org/datakurre/example.product
- https://saucelabs.com/u/exampleproduct

And then get started by yourself:


Require plone.app.robotframework
--------------------------------

Update ``setup.py`` to require *plone.app.robotframework*::

    extras_require={
        'test': [
            ...
            'plone.app.robotframework',
        ],
    },

All you need is *plone.app.robotframework*.
It will require the rest (*selenium*, *robotframework*,
*robotframework-selenium2library* and *robotsuite*).

.. note:: Because Selenium-bindings for Python use Firefox as the
   default browser, you should have Firefox installed in your system (unless
   you already know how to configure other browsers to work with Selenium).


Define functional testing layer
-------------------------------

Plone add-on testing requires defining test layers,
which setup Plone, the add-ons and any custom configuration
required by the tests.

Update your ``src/my/product/testing.py`` to include::

    from plone.testing import z2
    from plone.app.testing import FunctionalTesting
    from plone.app.robotframework.testing import AUTOLOGIN_LIBRARY_FIXTURE

    MY_PRODUCT_ROBOT_TESTING = FunctionalTesting(
        bases=(AUTOLOGIN_LIBRARY_FIXTURE, MY_PRODUCT_FIXTURE, z2.ZSERVER),
        name="MyProduct:Robot")

.. note:: AUTOLOGIN_LIBRARY_FIXTURE is optional, but it will allow you to
   write faster Selenium tests, because tests don't need to spend time on
   login forms.

If you don't have any testing layers for your product yet, or want to know
more about them, please read: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.testing


Install Robot-tools
-------------------

*plone.app.robotframework* ships with two main helper scripts for 
writing tests:

* ``bin/robot-server`` starts a temporary Plone site with the given
  test layer set up

* ``bin/robot`` executes Robot Framework's ``pybot``-runner so that it
  will run the given test suite agains the running ``robot-server``, 
  ensuring that tests will be run in isolation (database is cleaned between 
  the tests)

Update ``buildout.cfg``::

    [buildout]
    parts =
        ...
        robot

    [robot]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    eggs =
        Pillow
        ${test:eggs}
        plone.app.robotframework[ride,reload]

.. note:: Robot-tools are optional, but will ease and speed up test
   development. [reload]-extras will make ``robot-server`` to detect
   filesystem changes under ``./src`` and reload the test layer when a
   change is detected. [ride]-extras will create a script to start
   RIDE, the IDE for Robot Framework, but it can be launched only
   explicitly with a compatible system python with wxPython 2.8.x
   installed.

   If you can get RIDE running, though, you should select its *Run*-tab,
   change the value of *Execution Profile* to *custom script*, and click
   *Browser*-button to select *bin/robot* from the buildout
   directory. Running RIDE using *bin/robot* will enable test isolation
   to work when running tests from RIDE.

   If you want to place a breakpoint you can use the ``Comment`` keyword
   with argument ``PAUSE``. RIDE will stop and let you step through your test.

Start test server
-----------------

Once the buildout with Robot-tools is run, start the test server with::

    $ bin/robot-server my.product.testing.MY_PRODUCT_ROBOT_TESTING

Once the test server has started, there's a test Plone-site served
at http://localhost:55001/plone/.

.. note:: Technically ``robot-server`` only duplicates some existing
   magic from ``zope.testrunner`` to figure out all the required test
   layers and set them up in the required order.


Write the first test
--------------------

Robot tests are written in test suites, which are plain text files, usually
ending with ``.robot`` (and older ones with ``.txt``).

The first test can be written anywhere in the filesystem.

For example, a ``test_hello.robot``::

    *** Settings ***

    Resource  plone/app/robotframework/selenium.robot

    Test Setup  Open test browser
    Test Teardown  Close all browsers

    *** Test Cases ***

    Plone is installed
        Go to  ${PLONE_URL}
        Page should contain  Powered by Plone

Robot is all about running test clauses called **keywords**.
Every test case may contain one or more keywords, which are run sequentially --
usually until the first of them fails.

Keywords are defined in **keywords libraries** and as **user keywords**.
Keyword libraries can be Python libraries or XML-RPC-services.
User keywords are lists of test clauses reusing existing keywords.
User keywords may also re-use other user keywords.

Here is a more complicated example::

    *** Settings ***

    Resource  plone/app/robotframework/selenium.robot

    Library  Remote  ${PLONE_URL}/RobotRemote

    Test Setup  Open test browser
    Test Teardown  Close all browsers

    *** Test Cases ***

    Site Administrator can access control panel
        Given I'm logged in as a 'Site Administrator'
         When I open the personal menu
         Then I see the Site Setup -link

    *** Keywords ***

    I'm logged in as a '${ROLE}'
        Enable autologin as  ${ROLE}
        Go to  ${PLONE_URL}

    I open the personal menu
        Click link  css=#user-name

    I see the Site Setup -link
        Element should be visible  css=#personaltools-plone_setup

.. note:: We use ``.robot`` as the Robot Framework test suite
   file extension to make it easier for developers to
   configure Robot Framework syntax highlighting
   for their editors (otherwise ``.txt`` would work also).


Run the first test
------------------

Once the ``bin/robot-server`` has been started and a test suite has been
written, the test suite can be run with ``bin/robot``::

    $ bin/robot test_hello.robot


.. note::: ``bin/robot`` is a wrapper for Robot Framework's
   pybot test runner to  support plone.testing's test isolation
   for Plone when used together with bin/robot-server.


Integrate with Zope-testrunner
----------------------------

Because it's convenient to run Robot tests with other zope.testrunner
tests e.g. on Travis-CI, we usually want to integrate
Robot tests to be run with other tests using *zope.testrunner*.

For *zope.testrunner* integration, create
``src/my/product/tests/test_robot.py``::

    import unittest

    import robotsuite
    from my.product.testing import MY_PRODUCT_ROBOT_TESTING
    from plone.testing import layered


    def test_suite():
        suite = unittest.TestSuite()
        suite.addTests([
            layered(robotsuite.RobotTestSuite('test_hello.robot'),
                    layer=MY_PRODUCT_ROBOT_TESTING),
        ])
        return suite

.. note:: For this to work and ``zope.testrunner`` to discover your
   robot test suite, remember to move ``test_hello.robot`` under
   ``my/product/tests``.

It's good to know that this pattern is the same as how doctest suites are 
registered (e.g. in https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.testing) to use 
layers.  Also, RobotSuite is a Collective-package, the only purpose of
which is to wrap Robot Framework tests to be Python unittest compatible.


Integrate with Sauce Labs
-----------------------

1. Register an account for http://saucelabs.com/ with the *Open Sauce* plan.
   Derive username from product name. For example, ``myproduct``. Use your own
   contact email for the beginning.  It can be changed later.

2. Install travis-gem for your active Ruby-installation::

       $ sudo gem install travis

3. Log in to Sauce Labs to see your Sauce Labs access key (at the bottom of 
   the left column).

4. Encrypt Sauce Labs credentials into ``.travis.yml``::

       $ travis encrypt SAUCE_USERNAME=myusername -r mygithubname/myproduct --add env.global
       $ travis encrypt SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=myaccesskey -r mygithubname/myproduct --add env.global

5. Update ``.travis.yml`` to set up the Sauce Labs connection before tests::

       ---
       language: python
       python: '2.7'
       install:
       - mkdir -p buildout-cache/downloads
       - python bootstrap.py -c travis.cfg
       - bin/buildout -N -t 3 -c travis.cfg
       - curl -O http://saucelabs.com/downloads/Sauce-Connect-latest.zip
       - unzip Sauce-Connect-latest.zip
       - java -jar Sauce-Connect.jar $SAUCE_USERNAME $SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY -i $TRAVIS_JOB_ID -f CONNECTED &
       - JAVA_PID=$!
       - bash -c "while [ ! -f CONNECTED ]; do sleep 2; done"
       script: bin/test
       after_script:
       - kill $JAVA_PID
       env:
         global:
         - secure: ! (here's an encrypted variable created with travis-commmand)
         - secure: ! (here's an encrypted variable created with travis-commmand)
         - ROBOT_BUILD_NUMBER=travis-$TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER
         - ROBOT_REMOTE_URL=http://$SAUCE_USERNAME:$SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY@ondemand.saucelabs.com:80/wd/hub
         - ROBOT_DESIRED_CAPABILITIES=tunnel-identifier:$TRAVIS_JOB_ID

.. note:: If you already have an ``env`` section, for instance to define
   different versions of Plone like this::

       env:
         - PLONE_VERSION=4.0
         - PLONE_VERSION=4.1
         - PLONE_VERSION=4.2
         - PLONE_VERSION=4.3

   you will need to declare those variables in a ``matrix`` section, like this::

       env:
         matrix:
           - PLONE_VERSION=4.0
           - PLONE_VERSION=4.1
           - PLONE_VERSION=4.2
           - PLONE_VERSION=4.3
         global:
         - secure: ! (here's an encrypted variable created with travis-commmand)
         - secure: ! (here's an encrypted variable created with travis-commmand)
         - ROBOT_BUILD_NUMBER=travis-$TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER
         - ROBOT_REMOTE_URL=http://$SAUCE_USERNAME:$SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY@ondemand.saucelabs.com:80/wd/hub
         - ROBOT_DESIRED_CAPABILITIES=tunnel-identifier:$TRAVIS_JOB_ID

6. Update the test to use SauceLabs test browser::

       *** Settings ***

       ...

       Resource  plone/app/robotframework/saucelabs.robot

       Test Setup  Open SauceLabs test browser
       Test Teardown  Run keywords  Report test status  Close all browsers

       ...

7. Update ``travis.cfg`` to allow downloading robotframework-packages::

       [buildout]

       ...

       allow-hosts +=
           code.google.com
           robotframework.googlecode.com

.. note:: If you don't have Travis-CI-integration yet, you need to add ``travis.cfg``
   for the above ``.travis.yml`` to work::

       [buildout]
       extends = https://raw.github.com/collective/buildout.plonetest/master/travis-4.x.cfg

       package-name = my.product
       package-extras = [test]

       allow-hosts +=
           code.google.com
           robotframework.googlecode.com

       [environment]
       ZSERVER_HOST = 0.0.0.0
       ROBOT_ZOPE_HOST = 0.0.0.0

       [test]
       environment = environment

   The *environment*-part and line in *test*-part are optional, but are required to
   run tests using Internet Explorer (via SauceLabs) later.


Running sauce labs build manually
---------------------------------

0. Start ``bin/robot-server``::

       $ bin/robot-server my.product.testing.ROBOT_TESTING

1. Run tests with ``bin/robot``::

       $ bin/robot -v REMOTE_URL:http://SAUCE_USERNAME:SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY@ondemand.saucelabs.com:80/wd/hub -v BUILD_NUMBER:manual -v DESIRED_CAPABILITIES:tunnel-identifier:manual src/my/product/tests/test_product.robot

or

1. Create an argument file, e.g. ``saucelabs_arguments.txt``::

       -v REMOTE_URL:http://SAUCE_USERNAME:SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY@ondemand.saucelabs.com:80/wd/hub
       -v BUILD_NUMBER:manual
       -v DESIRED_CAPABILITIES:tunnel-identifier:manual

2. Execute ``bin/robot`` with the argument file option::

       bin/robot -A saucelabs_arguments.txt src/my/product/tests/test_product.robot


How to write more tests
-----------------------

The most difficult part in writing robot tests with Selenium-keywords is to know
the application you are testing: which link to click when and to which field to
input test data.

Robot Framework ships with a few selected standard libraries. One of them is the
*Dialogs*-library, which provides a very useful keyword: *Pause execution*. By
importing Dialogs-library (while developing the test) and adding the 
*Pause execution* keyword, you can pause the test at any point to make it 
possible to figure out what to do next. (Dialogs depend on
`TkInter-library <http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter>`_.)

For example::

    *** Settings ***

    Resource  plone/app/robotframework/selenium.robot
    Resource  plone/app/robotframework/saucelabs.robot

    Library  Remote  ${PLONE_URL}/RobotRemote

    Test Setup  Open SauceLabs test browser
    Test Teardown  Run keywords  Report test status  Close all browsers

    *** Test Cases ***

    Plomino is installed
        Go to  ${PLONE_URL}
        Pages should contain  mydb

    Let me think what to do next
        Enable autologin as  Site Administrator
        Go to  ${PLONE_URL}
        Import library  Dialogs
        Pause execution

.. note:: Be sure to remove the Dialogs-library import and its keywords
   before commit, because Dialogs-library may have dependencies,
   which are not available on your CI-machine.
