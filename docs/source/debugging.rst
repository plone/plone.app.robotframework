Debugging robot tests
=====================

1. Pause Selenium (WebDriver) completely to inspect your step with
   *Pause execution* keywords from *Dialogs*-library shipped with
   Robot Framework::

       Import library  Dialogs
       Pause execution

2. Pause Selenium (WebDriver) completely to inspect your step::

       Set Selenium timeout  600 seconds
       Wait for condition  true

3. Slow done Selenium (WebDriver) to make the tests easier to follow::

       Set Selenium speed  0.5s

4. Use plone.app.robotframework keywords to drop the Zope server into 
   debugger::

       Import library  plone.app.robotframework.keywords.Debugging
       Stop

5. Write a python keyword into your Python keyword library
   to drop the Zope server into debugger.

   There's one catch in debugging your code while running Robot Framework
   tests. Robot may eat your standard input and output, which prevents you to
   just ``import pdb; pdb.set_trace()``.

   Instead, you have to add a few more lines to reclaim your I/O at first, and
   only then let your debugger in::

       import sys
       import pdb
       for attr in ('stdin', 'stdout', 'stderr'):
           setattr(sys, attr, getattr(sys, '__%s__' % attr))
       pdb.set_trace()
